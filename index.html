<p>Henry Ford is known for many things he invented and popularized in his lifetime. Many of his inventions, such as business strategies like "<a title="The idea of Fordism is to combine mass production with mass consumption to grow a business."><b>Fordism</b><img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a>" and sponsored projects are still alive today. Ford skillfully adapted to his increasingly-urbanized environment and introduced revolutionary concepts to Americans that changed his present and America&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Ford successfully brought the automobile to consumers for a cheaper price, the assembly line to large businesses, and good wages for employees. His ability to initally adapt and innovate a new market brought him an incredible amount of wealth and fame.</p><br /><br />

  <h3 align="right">Ford's Illumination</h3>
  <p>Henry Ford lived from July 30, 1863 to April 7, 1947. Henry was the oldest in the family with 4 younger siblings.  As a boy, Ford grew up on a farm, but was always more interested in the machines then the work required of a farm boy. When he was fifteen years old, his father gave him a watch that he would disassemble and reassemble for fun, and he would fix his friends and neighbors' watches too. Three years after his <a title="Mary Litogot Ford was born and raised in Michigan, and she died of childbirth in 1876, when she was only 37 years old.">mother<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a> died in 1876, Henry Ford went to find work in Detriot, Michigan and became skilled at repairing steam engines.</p>
  <img src="images/Ford_quadricycle_crop.jpg" width="230px" height="145px" align="right" />
  <p>Ford was married in 1888 and had his only child, Edsel Ford, 5 years later. In 1891 Ford was hired at the Edison Illuminating Company, where he was quickly promoted up to Chief Engineer. He began testing gasoline-powered engines. The testing culminated in the <a title="The Quadricycle had two speeds of 10 and 20 mph, with no reverse. The gas tank could hold three gallons of gas.">Ford Quadricycle<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a>, which changed Henry's focus into creating automobiles for the masses.</p>

  <h3 align="right">Ford's Determination</h3>
  <p>The Ford Motor Company was Ford's 3rd attempt at creating an automobile business. His first company was the Detroit Automobile Company in which he was the Chief Engineer. This only lasted from 1899 to 1901 when Ford left the company because the automobiles were a low quality and were highly priced. Less than a year later came the Henry Ford Company, co-founded with <a title="Wills followed Ford through the Detriot Automobile Company on through to the Ford Motor Company, where he worked with Ford on designing cars en masse.">C. Harold Wills<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a>. After Wills brought <a title="A man who loved anything mechanical, he invented things like the Cadillac and electric barber clippers.">Henry Leland<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a> onto the team in 1902, Ford left the company, which was renamed the Cadillac Automobile Company.</p>
  <p>Ford's 3rd company began as "Ford &amp; Malcomson, Ltd." because Alexander Y. Malcomson was the financial backer for the company. John and Horace E. Dodge supplied the company with $160,000 worth of parts, but sales were slow, and when they demanded payment for the first shipment of parts, Malcomson had to bring in another group of investors and also had the Dodge brothers take a portion of the company, now renamed to the Ford Motor Company. The next step for the company was to gain popularity and obtain much needed profit. Going through all the different businesses taught Ford to manage things his own way or not at all. Ford later said, "<i>Before everything else, getting ready is the secret of success.</i>"</p>

  <img src="images/assembly1913.jpg" width="140px" height="149px" align="left" />
  <h3 align="right">Ford's Companies</h3>
  <p>Ford used his experiences from past businesses to shape the Ford Motor Company, making prices cheaper and giving his employees good wages to encourage them to continue working hard and buy from the company itself. One of Ford's beliefs was that, "<i>Competition is the keen cutting edge of business, always shaving away at costs</i>." To keep prices cheaper, Ford used <a title="Vertical integration is the opposite of a monopoly, so instead of buying up all the competition, you own the means of production, from collection of raw materials to the retail stores themselves.">vertical integration<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a> and hired skilled workers to lower training costs and run production more efficently. Instead of hiring and losing workers, he weeded out the best workers and encouraged them to continue working for him.</p>
  <img src="images/modelt.jpg" width="180px" height="119px" align="right" />
  <p>The <a title="The Model T set many precedents for modern cars, such as the left-side steering wheel placement.">Model T<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a> was what put Ford on top of the car industry. It was cheap to make and repair, and late into the 1910's almost every car on the road was a Model T. In 1913, Ford introduced the assembly line (see photo), which greatly increased production. 3 years later Ford had sold almost 500,000 Model T's, and by the time Ford stopped production of the car in 1927, he had produced 15 million Model T's.</p>

  <h3 align="right">Ford's Influence</h3>
	<video id="player" src="autoparade.mp4" controls></video>
  <p>This video clip shows possibly the first Automobile Parade on November 4, 1899. You'll notice that nearly all the horseless carriages, or cars, are of a different design, and only 20 years later Ford had made almost every car a Model T. Ford took advantage of the new and growing market and was able to build the highest income car company of his time.</p>

  <h3 align="right">Ford's Strategies</h3>
  <img src="images/ModelTassembly.jpg" width="250px" height="155px" align="left" />
  <p>"<i>It is not the employer who pays the wages. Employers only handle the money. It is the customer who pays the wages</i>."</p>
  <p>While Ford is often credited with the assembly line, many earlier groups used interchangeable parts to speed production, beginning as early as the <a title="A collection of clay soldiers that were had parts designed by lots of smiths and assembled on location. The soldiers are dated around 215 B.C.">Terracotta Army<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a>. Ford got the idea from Chicago meat packaging companies.<div id="image" style="padding: 0;"><a href="images/T-1913.jpg" title="This picture shows the manufacturing prices of 3 different models of the Model T in 1913. It is a good example of vertical integration because you see the costs of the different means of production."><img src="images/T-1913.jpg" width="175px" height="122x" align="right" /></a></div>What Ford did manage to do is popularize the idea in America, and essentially all large-scale businesses had to have interchangeable parts to stay in business.</p>
  <p>Bettering workers' wages was also an excellent example of lowering costs. The higher wages attracted the best mechanics and brute labor to work for Ford, which meant that Ford had to hire new workers much less often and labor costs came down because the labor was more skilled and efficent.</p>

  <h3 align="right">Personal Legacy</h3>
  <img src="images/fordfound.jpg" width="287px" height="350px" align="left" />
  <p>Ford was a shining example of <a title="Carnegie envisioned America as a place where the wealthy and impoverished could live together in harmony, with the poor working for the rich and the rich giving back to the poor any &quot;excess wealth.&quot;">Andrew Carnegie's vision<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a> of America. Ford was a stout philanthropist, creating <a title="The Ford Foundation is a large non-profit organization built to advance human welfare, and specifically in Ford's time to help the Detriot area.">The Ford Foundation<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a> and donating monetary gifts to various states and <a title="One example is Ford's donation to Berry College to help make the new Ford Gym, where Ford demanded that at the opening ceremony the kids have a dance, which was a first for Berry College.">colleges<img id="noteicon" src="images/note.png" /></a>. As Ford said, &quot;<i>An idealist is a person who helps other people to be prosperous</i>.&quot; And as Charles E. Sorensen puts it, &quot;<i>He was ruthless in getting his own way, yet he had a deep sense of public responsibility</i>,&quot; and &quot;<i>He was contemptuous of money-making, of money-makers and profit seekers, yet he made more money and greater profits than those he despised</i>.&quot;

<br><b>1913: Ford assembly line. 1913.</b><br>
A photograph displaying workers using the assembly line in the factory. This photo fits in great with my &quot;Ford Motor Company&quot; section because it clearly shows Ford&rsquo;s idea in action.<br><br>

<b>Edison, Thomas A. &quot;Automobile Parade.&quot; Automobile Parade. 6 Feb. 1900.</b><br>
This is a black-and-white video clip showing the Automobile Parade in 1900 that ironically ends with a horse buggy getting stuck in the traffic. This is a great video that really shows how popular cars in general were becoming even by 1900.<br><br>

<b>Ford, Henry. My Life and Work. Grand Rapids: Kessinger, LLC, 2003.</b><br>
An autobiography with Ford&rsquo;s own personal insight on how to run a successful business. It gave me some insight, such as his determination and unique ideas, into why and how Ford managed such feats as he did.

A photograph of Henry Ford once he was in his prime in 1919. This is my favorite picture of Ford because he looks like he is on top of the world in a subtle way, which is why it is used on the front page of the website.<br><br>

<b>Henderson, Jim. Looking east at Ford Foundation headquarters on a sunny afternoon. 16 Aug. 2008.</b><br>
A recent photograph of the Ford Foundation headquarters. This picture is a great compliment to the &quot;Personal Legacy&quot; page because it shows just one of the many things Ford donated money to.<br><br>

This book is set in a world where there were 50 new automobile companies a year, Ford managed to be the top dog by promoting the Model T car for everyone, not just the rich. It looks into how Ford managed to go from farm boy to mass production giant, and what mostly helped me was its description of the beginning steps he took that have had lasting effects on our society.<br><br>

<b>Brinkley, Douglas G. Wheels for the World : Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress. New York: Viking Adult, 2003.</b><br>
In this book, Brinkley takes a look at the Ford Motor Company at large, and has a large portion that really shows Henrys work with it. It helped me gain a better understanding of how Ford began and managed a nearly self-sufficient business.<br><br>

<b>Bushnell, Sarah T. The Truth about Henry Ford. The Reilly &amp; Lee Co., 1922.</b><br>
This book contains extensive interviews prominently by Mrs. Henry Ford, along with friends of Ford in his early days. It was great for my research because of all of the information Mrs. Ford has about the man himself.</div>

New York, NY: Encounter Books, 2002.</b> This book focuses on 3 generations of Fords, starting with Henry and ending with his grandson, depicting their control of the Ford Motor Company. The book was unique for my research because Collier and Horowitz provide a unique view on the Fords&rsquo; empire by focusing on the men who led the company and the direct effects of their leadership and relationships with each other.<br><br>
